The Photon is a prototyping tool that comes with a Wi-Fi chipset. This enables interfacing sensors/actuators to the internet and monitor them remotely. This lamp is equipped with a 24 Pixel circular RGB LED strip called the [Neopixel from Adafruit Industries ](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1586). \r\n\r\nThe Particle Photon can produce different color combinations on the RGB LED strip as shown in the picture below:  \r\n  \r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sai-y/photon_desktop_lamp/master/desktop_lamp.jpg) \r\n\r\n### Setting up the lamp\r\n\r\nThe following are needed for the lamp:  \r\n  \r\n1.
