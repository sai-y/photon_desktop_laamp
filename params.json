{"name":"The Rollbar alert lamp","tagline":"A 3D printed lamp that changes its behavior upon receiving a rollbar alert","body":"### General Description of the lamp\r\n\r\nThis 3D printed desktop lamp is enabled by a [Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/). The Photon is a prototyping tool that comes with a Wi-Fi chipset. This enables interfacing sensors/actuators to the internet and monitor them remotely. This lamp is equipped with a 24 Pixel circular RGB LED strip called the [Neopixel from Adafruit Industries ](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1586). \r\n\r\nThe Particle Photon can produce different color combinations on the RGB LED strip as shown in the picture below:  \r\n  \r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sai-y/photon_desktop_lamp/master/desktop_lamp.jpg) \r\n\r\n## Building the lamp\r\n\r\nThe following are needed to build the lamp:  \r\n  \r\n1. [Particle Photon](https://store.particle.io/)  \r\n2. 3D printed enclosure + lamp shade  \r\n3. Micro USB cable  \r\n4. [24 pixel Neopixel ring](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2268). \r\n  \r\n### Particle Photon\r\n\r\nThe Particle Photon has to be setup to receive rollbar alerts. This includes adding the [WiFi credentials](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/start/photon/) to the Photon. \r\nThe firmware files for Particle Photon is available from [here](https://github.com/sai-y/photon_desktop_lamp/tree/master/firmware). This [tutorial](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/build/photon/) explains compiling the code and flashing it on the Photon.  \r\n  \r\nWhen there are no rollbar alerts, the lamp glows white:  \r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/2F0I7H2.gif)\r\n  \r\nIn order to trigger the Particle Photon for an alert, the device id and an access token is necessary. This information is available at particle.io\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/fc4jrqk.jpg) ![](http://i.imgur.com/xgCMGtR.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Setting up Rollbar webhooks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
